Client side of a tool to teach new RoboHawks programmers skills like Java, version control, and the RoboHawks API
## Deprecation Notice
As of May 2021, this repository is no longer necessary due to the [robohawks-learning-platform](https://github.com/isaackrementsov/robohawks-learning-platform) parent project moving to a full-stack Next.js setup. All client-side code can be now found in the parent repo's `v3` branch.
